There's an old Mitch Hedberg joke that goes "rice is great if you're 
really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something."  Baseball 
is kind of like that.  You have 162 games in the regular season where 
nine batters will get 3-5 chances to hit each game per team. The chance 
of getting a hit ranges from about 10% (not very good player) to about 
30% (very good player) for each attempt. Over the course of the long 
season, a player can string together a series of hits (hot streak) or 
a series of outs (cold streak).  These streaks could be due to something 
the player is doing (with the intrinsic probability of a hit changing), 
but can often be explained by statistical variance (with a fixed probability). 

The same thing can happen when we consider the team as a whole. A team that 
wins 100 out its 162 games is very good (usually enough to win the division). 
However, this is only a winning percentage of about 62%.  Better than flipping 
a coin, but not by a whole lot. So again, just by statistical chance, you could 
get hot streaks (win a bunch) or cold streaks (lose a bunch). But it is also 
possible that the team is just getting better or worse. Is there a way to 
tell the difference?  Can we quantify when to panic?


Motivation 
============

This exercise is mostly motivated by watching the ups and then 
sustained downs of my team, the Philadelphia Phillies.  After 
getting out to a really hot start, the team started losing a lot 
more often in July and into August. Despite continuing to have 
one of (if not the) best record in baseball, fans started to panic. 
Sensing an opportunity to smugly explain this away as statistical 
variance, I took a look at the numbers[^1].

Grabbing the results for the 112 games at that point from 
[baseball-reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com), 
we can get a sense for how things changed over the course of 
the season (to that point). First we can plot the cumulative 
win fraction for the season.  That is, 
for each game, we add up all the wins to that point and divide by the 
total number of games to that point.  This will vary a lot early on 
because each game counts for more of the average, but will eventually 
steady out as each game is relatively less and less important.  The 
results are shown in the next plot:

    Fig 1:  <em>Cumulative win rate for the season</em>
</p>

which tracks with experience. To get a sense for how good that peak is, 
note that only 15 teams have finished a season with a winning 
percentage above 70% (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best_Major_League_Baseball_season_win%E2%80%93loss_records)). 

But if we are looking for ups and downs, maybe it is better to 
consider stretches of games.  For example, we can check the 
win fraction for a rolling 20-game window.  That is, we look 
at the last 20 games and calculate the fraction of games that 
were wins.  We then go to the next game and do the same.  This 
means that at each step we are adding the most recent game and 
removing the last game in the window.  The results are shown in 
the following plot:

</p>

This plot certainly tracks with how the season has felt.  The team 
got off to a very hot start, then eventually started cooling off 
and losing more and more games.

Now we can finally get to the point: the highest win rate for a 
20 game stretch this season is 0.85 and the lowest is 0.30.  Are 
these consistent with a good team that will win 95-100 games?


The Problem
=============

Let's try to state the problem mathematically.  Assume we have 
a binomial process that has two outcomes: a win or a loss. 
Let $$p$$ be the probability of a win, so that $$1-p$$ is the 
probability of a loss.  For a list of $$N$$ games, what is 
the probability that the highest number of wins (or losses) 
in any $$M$$ game window is greater than or equal to $$k$$. 
For Figure 2, we have $$N=112$$ and $$M=20$$.  The max number 
of observed wins in a window is 17 and the max number of observed 
losses in a window is 14. We want to determine if these are 
statistically significant deviations for some given winning 
probability of $$p$$.

Note that rolling $$M$$ game window makes things a little 
tricky. If we had just said *What is the probability that 
we get k or more wins in a list of M games?*, then the 
solution would be given by the 
[binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), 
which we could easily calculate. If we were considering independent 
groups of $$M$$ games, we could calculate the probility for one 
and then use the binomial distribution again to calculate over 
the full season. 

What makes our problem tricky is that, while the games themselves 
are independent, the counts in the rolling $$M$$ game window are 
*not independent*. We can see this by considering a 20 game window 
that has 15 wins.  When we shift over to the next game, we lose 
the least recent game (which could have been a win or a loss) and 
gain the most recent game (which again could be a win or a loss). 
That means that the number of wins in this window is constrained. 
It could only be 14 (if you drop a win and gain a loss),
15 (if the result you drop is the same you gain), or 16 (if you drop 
a loss and gain a win). To state it a bit more clearly, the 
number of wins in the current 20 game window depends on the 
current game and the previous 19.


An Easy Solution
==================

If we just want to get an answer, we could just run a bunch of 
simulations and tally the results.  This is what I did first, so 
let's give it a try. A binomial process is very easy to simulate, 
so long as we have a way of generating a random number that is 
uniformly distributed on the interval $$[0, 1)$$.  If we draw 
a number $$d$$ in this interval, we will consider the event a 
win if $$d\leq p$$, otherwise it's a loss.  Doing this $$N$$ 
times gets us a season. Once we generate a season, we can loop 
through and find the max wins and losses in a rolling 20 game window.

In Figure 3, we show the results of 100,000 simulated runs of 
112 games.  In this case we took a fixed win probability of 
$$p=0.6$$, simulated a stretch of 112 games, then found the 
largest number of wins (losses) in a 20 game window. We then 
repeated this 100,000 times.  The blue histogram in Figure 3 
represents the 100,000 max wins and the orange histogram gives 
the 100,000 max losses. I have also indicated the observed values 
(wins = 17, losses = 14).  


<p align="center">

                constant win probability of 0.6</em>
</p>

So are the observed max wins/losses values consistent with a 
win value of $$p=0.6$$?  Well, yeah, kinda. They certainly 
fall within the respective histograms (although the losses 
seem to be a bit further out on the tail than the wins).
But ideally we would be able to calculate a probability for 
each $$p$$.  So let's do that!

Let's focus on what we set out to calculate.  That is, we want 
to find the probability that the highest number of wins 
(or losses) in a 20 game window throughout the season exceeds 
some number $$k$$.  So we'll now run our simulations for a range 
of $$p$$ values and calculate this number by simply counting 
the number of max values that equal or exceed $$k$$.  So for 
wins, we will simulate our 100,000 seasons and find the most 
wins in a 20-game window for each.  We will then count how many 
of these are greater than or equal to 17, and divide by the total 
number of simulations to get a probability.  We can do the same 
for losses. 

Figure 4 below shows these results. The blue line gives the 
probability that the max number of wins in a 20 game window 
is greater than or equal to 17 for a range of win probabilities. 
Likewise the orange curve shows the probability that the max number 
of losses is greater than or equal to 14.

                and losses (orange) exceed the observed 
                values as a function of win probability.</em>
</p>

These curves behave as we would expect.  If the win probability 
is very low, then the probability of getting a max of at least 
14 losses in a 20 game window is very good (i.e., 1). Likewise, 
if the win probability is very high, then the probability of 
getting a max of at least 17 wins in a 20 game window is very 
good (i.e., 1). However, it is odd that the intersection 
occurs at such a low probability (about 6%), but this could 
be evidence against our assumption that $$p$$ is fixed 
for the whole season.

Figure 4 showed the individual probability curves for losses 
and wins as a function of individual game win probability. But 
we want both of these to be true at the same time (since that's what 
we saw).  To get the probability the max wins is greater than or 
equal to 17 **and** the max losses is greater than or equal to 14, 
we simply multiply the probabilities.  The result is shown 
below in Figure 5.

</p>

This curve is a little noisy, but still looks about how we would expect 
by multiplying the two curves in Figure 4.  It has to go toward zero 
on the left because our blue curve goes to zero and it has to go toward 
zero on the right because our orange curve goes to zero.  It is maximum 
where the two curves from Figure 4 intersect.  The peak of this probability 
curve is around $$p=0.57$$, which is very close to the cumulative winning 
fraction after 112 games from Figure 2. With this win probability, 
we would expect the team to win about 92 out of 162 games for the 
regular season. Not setting any records, but still pretty good. 


Conclusions
==============

By simulating the results, we were able to numerically calculate 
the probability of the maximum number of wins (or losses) in a 
20 game window exceeding some particular value.  Based on this, 
we see that the Phillies season probably has not been super well 
described by a single unchanging win probability.  To properly 
evaluate that claim, however, we would need to do some kind of 
model comparison.

However, in the next part we will *not* be doing that!  Instead 
we will consider a fun (?) yet **highly impractical** way of 
calculating the desired probability without simulations.
