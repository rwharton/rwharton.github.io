There are 13 US states with [peak elevations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_elevation) above 10,000 feet.
The state of Delaware is not one of them.
Not even close. [Ebright Azimuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebright_Azimuth), 
the highest point in Delaware, tops out at 448 feet above sea level.
Around Christmas 2023, my brother and I reached the summit.
Next up, [Britton Hill, Florida!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britton_Hill)
