</p>

<p>There’s an old Mitch Hedberg joke that goes “rice is great if you’re 
really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something.”  Baseball 
is kind of like that.  You have 162 games in the regular season where 
nine batters will get 3-5 chances to hit each game per team. The chance 
of getting a hit ranges from about 10% (not very good player) to about 
30% (very good player) for each attempt. Over the course of the long 
season, a player can string together a series of hits (hot streak) or 
a series of outs (cold streak).  These streaks could be due to something 
the player is doing (with the intrinsic probability of a hit changing), 
but can often be explained by statistical variance (with a fixed probability).</p>

<p>The same thing can happen when we consider the team as a whole. A team that 
wins 100 out its 162 games is very good (usually enough to win the division). 
However, this is only a winning percentage of about 62%.  Better than flipping 
a coin, but not by a whole lot. So again, just by statistical chance, you could 
get hot streaks (win a bunch) or cold streaks (lose a bunch). But it is also 
possible that the team is just getting better or worse. Is there a way to 
tell the difference?  Can we quantify when to panic?</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>This exercise is mostly motivated by watching the ups and then 
sustained downs of my team, the Philadelphia Phillies.  After 
getting out to a really hot start, the team started losing a lot 
more often in July and into August. Despite continuing to have 
one of (if not the) best record in baseball, fans started to panic. 
Sensing an opportunity to smugly explain this away as statistical 
variance, I took a look at the numbers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Grabbing the results for the 112 games at that point from 
<a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com">baseball-reference.com</a>, 
we can get a sense for how things changed over the course of 
the season (to that point). First we can plot the cumulative 
win fraction for the season.  That is, 
for each game, we add up all the wins to that point and divide by the 
total number of games to that point.  This will vary a lot early on 
because each game counts for more of the average, but will eventually 
steady out as each game is relatively less and less important.  The 
results are shown in the next plot:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Cumulative Win Rate" src="/images/blog/bball/tot_rate_fig.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 1:  <em>Cumulative win rate for the season</em>
</p>

<p>which tracks with experience. To get a sense for how good that peak is, 
note that only 15 teams have finished a season with a winning 
percentage above 70% (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best_Major_League_Baseball_season_win%E2%80%93loss_records">here</a>).</p>

<p>But if we are looking for ups and downs, maybe it is better to 
consider stretches of games.  For example, we can check the 
win fraction for a rolling 20-game window.  That is, we look 
at the last 20 games and calculate the fraction of games that 
were wins.  We then go to the next game and do the same.  This 
means that at each step we are adding the most recent game and 
removing the last game in the window.  The results are shown in 
the following plot:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Window Wins" src="/images/blog/bball/roll_20_fig.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 2:  <em>Winning Rate in a rolling 20 game window</em>
</p>

<p>This plot certainly tracks with out the season has felt.  The team 
got off to a very hot start, then eventually started cooling off 
and losing more and more games.</p>

<p>Now we can finally get to the point: the highest win rate for a 
20 game stretch this season is 0.85 and the lowest is 0.30.  Are 
these consistent with a good team that will win 95-100 games?</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>

<p>Let’s try to state the problem mathematically.  Assume we have 
a binomial process that has two outcomes: a win or a loss. 
Let \(p\) be the probability of a win, so that \(1-p\) is the 
probability of a loss.  For a list of \(N\) games, what is 
the probability that the highest number of wins (or losses) 
in any \(M\) game window is greater than or equal to \(k\). 
For Figure 2, we have \(N=112\) and \(M=20\).  The max number 
of observed wins in a window is 17 and the max number of observed 
losses in a window is 14. We want to determine if these are 
statistically significant deviations for some given winning 
probability of \(p\).</p>

<p>Note that rolling \(M\) game window makes things a little 
tricky. If we had just said <em>What is the probability that 
we get k or more wins in a list of M games?</em>, then the 
solution would be given by the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>, 
which we could easily calculate. If we were considering independent 
groups of \(M\) games, we could calculate the probility for one 
and then use the binomial distribution again to calculate over 
the full season.</p>

<p>What makes our problem tricky is that, while the games themselves 
are independent, the counts in the rolling \(M\) game window are 
<em>not independent</em>. We can see this by considering a 20 game window 
that has 15 wins.  When we shift over to the next game, we lose 
the least recent game (which could have been a win or a loss) and 
gain the most recent game (which again could be a win or a loss). 
That means that the number of wins in this window is constrained. 
It could only be 14 (if you drop a win and gain a loss),
15 (if the result you drop is the same you gain), or 16 (if you drop 
a loss and gain a win). To state it a bit more clearly, the 
number of wins in the current 20 game window depends on the 
current game and the previous 19.</p>

<h1 id="an-easy-solution">An Easy Solution</h1>

<p>If we just want to get an answer, we could just run a bunch of 
simulations and tally the results.  This is what I did first, so 
let’s give it a try. A binomial process is very easy to simulate, 
so long as we have a way of generating a random number that is 
uniformly distributed on the interval \([0, 1)\).  If we draw 
a number \(d\) in this interval, we will consider the event a 
win if \(d\leq p\), otherwise it’s a loss.  Doing this \(N\) 
times gets us a season. Once we generate a season, we can loop 
through and find the max wins and losses in a rolling 20 game window.</p>

<p>In Figure 3, we show the results of 100,000 simulated runs of 
112 games.  In this case we took a fixed win probability of 
\(p=0.6\), simulated a stretch of 112 games, then found the 
largest number of wins (losses) in a 20 game window. We then 
repeated this 100,000 times.  The blue histogram in Figure 3 
represents the 100,000 max wins and the orange histogram gives 
the 100,000 max losses. I have also indicated the observed values 
(wins = 17, losses = 14).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Simulation" src="/images/blog/bball/sim_hist_fig.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 3:  <em>Max wins (blue) and losses (orange) in a 20-game window 
                in 100,000 simulated 112 game stretches assuming a 
                constant win probability of 0.6</em>
</p>

<p>So are the observed max wins/losses values consistent with a 
win value of \(p=0.6\)?  Well, yeah, kinda. They certainly 
fall within the respective histograms (although the losses 
seem to be a bit further out on the tail than the wins).
But ideally we would be able to calculate a probability for 
each \(p\).  So let’s do that!</p>

<p>Let’s focus on what we set out to calculate.  That is, we want 
to find the probability that the highest number of wins 
(or losses) in a 20 game window throughout the season exceeds 
some number \(k\).  So we’ll now run our simulations for a range 
of \(p\) values and calculate this number by simply counting 
the number of max values that equal or exceed \(k\).  So for 
wins, we will simulate our 100,000 seasons and find the most 
wins in a 20-game window for each.  We will then count how many 
of these are greater than or equal to 17, and divide by the total 
number of simulations to get a probability.  We can do the same 
for losses.</p>

<p>Figure 4 below shows these results. The blue line gives the 
probability that the max number of wins in a 20 game window 
is greater than or equal to 17 for a range of win probabilities. 
Likewise the orange curve shows the probability that the max number 
of losses is greater than or equal to 14.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Sim" src="/images/blog/bball/sim_prob_fig.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 4:  <em>Probability that the max number of wins (blue) 
                and losses (orange) exceed the observed 
                values as a function of win probability.</em>
</p>

<p>These curves behave as we would expect.  If the win probability 
is very low, then the probability of getting a max of at least 
14 losses in a 20 game window is very good (i.e., 1). Likewise, 
if the win probability is very high, then the probability of 
getting a max of at least 17 wins in a 20 game window is very 
good (i.e., 1). However, it is odd that the intersection 
occurs at such a low probability (about 6%), but this could 
be evidence against our assumption that \(p\) is fixed 
for the whole season.</p>

<p>Figure 4 showed the individual probability curves for losses 
and wins as a function of individual game win probability. But 
we want both of these to be true at the same time (since that’s what 
we saw).  To get the probability the max wins is greater than or 
equal to 17 <strong>and</strong> the max losses is greater than or equal to 14, 
we simply multiply the probabilities.  The result is shown 
below in Figure 5.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Sim" src="/images/blog/bball/sim_prob_prod_fig.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 5:  <em>Product of the two probability curves from Figure 4</em>
</p>

<p>This curve is a little noisy, but still looks about how we would expect 
by multiplying the two curves in Figure 4.  It has to go toward zero 
on the left because our blue curve goes to zero and it has to go toward 
zero on the right because our orange curve goes to zero.  It is maximum 
where the two curves from Figure 4 intersect.  The peak of this probability 
curve is around \(p=0.57\), which is very close to the cumulative winning 
fraction after 112 games from Figure 2. With this win probability, 
we would expect the team to win about 92 out of 162 games for the 
regular season. Not setting any records, but still pretty good.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>By simulating the results, we were able to numerically calculate 
the probability of the maximum number of wins (or losses) in a 
20 game window exceeding some particular value.  Based on this, 
we see that the Phillies season probably has not been super well 
described by a single unchanging win probability.  To properly 
evaluate that claim, however, we would need to do some kind of 
model comparison.</p>

<p>However, in the next part we will <em>not</em> be doing that!  Instead 
we will consider a fun (?) yet <strong>highly impractical</strong> way of 
calculating the desired probability without simulations.</p>

    <em>Sad Old Sun</em>
</p>

<p>Today is the transit of Venus, which, aside from being a totally rad
astronomical event, is also the perfect excuse to tell my favorite story
of an unlucky Frenchman (I have many). This is by no means new and, if
you’ve ever taken an astronomy course, you’ve probably already heard it.
It is perhaps the closest thing Astronomy has to a ghost story, told
though the glow of a flashlight on moonless nights to scare the
children. This is the story of Guillaume Le Gentil, a dude that just
couldn’t catch a break.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisière was
a Frenchman with an incredibly long name. He was also an astronomer,
though he hadn’t started out that way. Monsieur Le Gentil (as his
friends called him and so, then, shall we) had originally intended to
enter the priesthood. However, he soon began sneaking away to hear
astronomy lectures and quickly switched from studies of Heaven to those
heavens more readily observed in a telescope. Le Gentil happened to get
into the astronomy game at a very exciting time. The next pair of Venus
transits was imminent and astronomers were giddy with anticipation.
Though the previous transit of 1639 had been predicted, it was met with
little fanfare and only a few measurements. But the transits of 1761 and
1769 would be different. People would be ready. And the stakes were
higher this time, too. Soon after the 1639 transit, Edmund Halley (he of
the-only-comet-people-can-name fame) calculated that with enough
simultaneous measurements, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the
so-called astronomical unit, or AU) could be measured fairly accurately.
Since almost all other astronomical distances were known in terms of the
AU, knowing its precise value would essentially set the scale for the
cosmos. Brand new telescopes in hand, the astronomers of Europe set sail
for locations all over the world.</p>

<p>Le Gentil had been assigned to observe the transit from Pondicherry, a
French holding on the eastern side of India. On March 26th, 1760, he
began his long sea voyage around the Cape of Good Hope towards India.</p>

<p>The voyage from France to India was a bit too long for the ship Le
Gentil hitched a ride on and he only made it as far as Mauritius (a
small island off Madagascar). Dropped off with all his equipment, Le
Gentil was left waiting for any ship at all to take him to Pondicherry.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the Curse of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">Dodo</a> or perhaps it was just bad
luck, but while he was waiting, Le Gentil learned that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years'_War">war</a> had broken out
between the French and the British, making a trip to British India very
difficult for a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Then the monsoon season started, meaning that even if he could find a
ship, it would have to take a much longer route to India than initially
planned and that it would be very difficult to make the journey before
the transit occurred.</p>

<p>Then, he caught dysentery for the first time.</p>

<p>Finally, after months of waiting, Le Gentil (barely recovered from his
illness) left Mauritius for India in February of 1761. Though time
appeared to be running out, the captain of the ship he was on promised
he would be there to observe the transit in June. About halfway to
India, the winds switched directions and the ship was forced to turn
back to Mauritius.</p>

<p>Le Gentil dutifully observed the transit of Venus in 1761 from a rocky
ship in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The data were useless and he
never attempted any analysis.</p>

<p>Although he missed the first transit, these things come in pairs
separated by eight years. There was still another chance. And with all
this time to prepare, there was no way he was going to miss the second
one.</p>

<p>In fact, there was a bit <em>too much</em> time. But as a world-traveling 18th
century man of science, Le Gentil had plenty of other interests to fill
his days. He was particularly interested in surveying the region around
Madagascar.</p>

<p>So he made a really nice map of Madagascar. And then he ate some bad
kind of some kind of animal and came down with a terrible sickness. He
describes this illness and its “cure” in his journals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This sickness was a sort of violent stroke, of which several very
copious blood-lettings made immediately on my arm and my foot, and
emetic administered twelve hours afterwards, rid me of it quite
quickly. But there remained for seven or eight days in my optic nerve
a singular impression from this sickness; it was to see two objects in
the place of one, beside each other; this illusion disappeared little
by little as I regained my strength…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After recovering from both his sickness and the treatment, Le Gentil
decided to begin his preparations for the 1769 transit of Venus. He
calculated that either Manila or the Mariana Islands would be the ideal
spot to observe. The Sun would be relatively high in the sky at both
places when Venus passed by, meaning that the view would be through less
atmosphere with a reduced chance of clouds passing through the line of
sight. Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed off to Manila, where he
could catch another ship to get to the Mariana Islands. Arriving in
Manila in 1766, the astronomer found himself exhausted from months of
sickness and sea-voyage. So, when he was offered passage on a ship
heading to the Mariana Islands, he quickly declined. That he chose not
to depart Manila at that time was perhaps his one stroke of good luck in
the entire journey. The ship sunk. Writing in his journal, Le Gentil
appears to have developed that particular sense of humor that generally
accompanies constant disappointment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is true that only three or four people were drowned, those who
were the most eager to save themselves, which is what almost always
happens in shipwrecks. I cannot answer that I would not have
increased the number of persons eager to save themselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, Le Gentil was in Manila with plenty of time to prepare for
the next transit. Unfortunately, the astronomer may have over-prepared.
Having arrived three years before the event, he now had three years to
worry and second-guess his decision. It didn’t help that the Spanish
governor of Manila was kind of a crazy person. Not wanting to miss the
observation of a lifetime owing to the whims of mildly insane strong
man, Le Gentil packed up his stuff and headed to Pondicherry. Finally in
Pondicherry, Le Gentil worked tirelessly to construct his observatory
and make plenty of astronomical observations in preparation for the
event. He had state of the art equipment and had fully calibrated and
double checked everything. It was now nine years since his journey began
and only a few days until the transit was scheduled to occur at sunrise
on June 4th. The entire month of May was beautiful weather and pristine
observing conditions, as were the first few days of June. Le Gentil
likely went to bed on the 3rd of June fully confident that the next
morning would be no different. He woke up early in the morning to begin
preparations for his sunrise observations only to find clouds on the
horizon. The clouds remained, obscuring the sun, all through the
duration of the transit. A few hours after the end of the transit, the
sun broke through the clouds and remained visible for the rest of the
day. Le Gentil had missed his second transit in Pondicherry. He sums it
up in his journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>That is the fate which often awaits astronomers. I had gone more
than ten thousand leagues; it seemed that I had crossed such a great
expanse of seas, exiling myself from my native land, only to be the
spectator of a fatal cloud which came to place itself before the sun
at the precise moment of my observation, to carry off from me the
fruits of my pains and of my fatigues</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Manila, the Sun rose in perfectly clear skies. Distraught, Le Gentil
remained in bed for some weeks afterward. He soon caught a fever and
missed the ship that was supposed to take him home. He recovered, but
then came down with dysentery again. Barely recovered from his various
illnesses, he managed to get a ride back to Mauritius. He caught a ship
leaving the island in November of 1770. The ship was struck by a
hurricane and almost completely destroyed. It managed to limp back to
Mauritius. The second attempt proved more successful and Le Gentil
finally “set foot on France at nine o’clock in the morning, after eleven
years, six months and thirteen days of absence.” Though he had finally
made it home, he was not out of the woods quite yet. In his absence, Le
Gentil’s heirs had tried to declare him dead to gain their inheritance,
his accountant had mishandled (and lost) a large chunk of his holdings,
and the Academy of Sciences, which had sent him on his 11 year mission,
had given his seat to someone else. It was not quite the welcome home he
had hoped for. Despite his seemingly never-ending misfortune, things did
turn around for Le Gentil. He married, had a daughter, and was
reinstated into the Academy of Sciences. Presumably, he lived out the
rest of his days in relative happiness. Le Gentil died in 1792. Keeping
true to his style, this man who missed two of the most important
astronomical events of his time fortunately managed to also miss the
most important (and violent) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror">political
event</a> of his time.</p>

    <em>The bearded half of Hulse-Taylor</em>
</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was on a bus going through Scranton and I read a
super-awesome fun fact regarding the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in
<em>Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars</em>. Sadly, I have since
forgotten it and left the book a few thousand miles away. So, let’s just
make up our own!</p>

<p>First, we need a little background. What the heck is a
pulsar? A pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star that beams
electromagnetic radiation towards us, which is how we can see them.
Typical rotation periods range from a millisecond to a few seconds. So
each time the pulsar rotates, we observe a blip when the radiation beams
towards us. Since these objects are additionally very stable rotators,
they are essentially very accurate clocks with which we may make
astronomical measurements.</p>

<p>So what’s the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar? The
Hulse-Taylor binary is almost exactly what it sounds like: it’s a pulsar
binary where one of the pulsars is pointed towards earth. It was the
first binary of it’s kind discovered and offers a unique look into a
very high gravity environment. It also provided a very nice test for
General Relativity. General Relativity predicts that two orbiting
massive bodies should emit gravitational waves. This emission of
gravitational waves will then cause the orbit to decay and the two
bodies to move closer together. So does the Hulse-Taylor binary show
this? Take a look:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Oribital Decay" src="/images/orbital_decay.jpg" width="350" />
  <br />
    <em>Orbital Decay of B1913+16 (Image credit: wikipedia)</em>
</p>

<p>The data fit the prediction of general relativity perfectly! For this
discovery Hulse and Taylor shared the 1993 Nobel prize in Physics.</p>

<p>Now that’s all well and good, but I was promised some fun facts…? Ah, yes!
Well, we mentioned that the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit is decaying. It
turns out that the orbit is decaying at about 3.5 meters per year.
That’s pretty slow. Let’s put it into a more conventional speed, like
meters per second. So</p>

\[3.5 {\rm m/yr} = 
   3.5 {\rm m/yr} \times \frac{1 \rm year}{3.14\times 10^7 \rm s} = 
   1.1 \times 10^{-7} {\rm m/s}\]

<p>or, in less useful units,</p>

\[3.5 {\rm m/yr} = 110 {\rm nm/s}\]

<p>Great, so what to compare this to? Well, all
people who are in the know know that I am a manly man who gained the
ability to grow facial hair sometime after my sophomore year of college.
And since I have to pretend to be an upstanding member of society this
week, I happen to know the last time I shaved. Thus, a few simple
measurements and I can estimate how long hair takes to grow.</p>

<p>The last
time I shaved was three days ago and a quick eyeball measurement (sadly
I have no ruler) gives a facial hair length of about 2mm. Thus, a beard
grows at about 0.7 mm/day.</p>

\[0.7 {\rm mm/day} = 
   0.7 {\rm mm/day} \times\frac{10^{-3} \rm m}{\rm mm} 
       \times \frac{1 \rm day}{86400\rm s} = 
   8 {\rm nm/s}\]

<p>This is a universal speed constant, which we shall call the speed of beard. 
Or, bowing to our corporate sponsors, we shall call it 
“Gillette Mach 1.” So doing a quick division, we find that the rate at 
which theHulse-Taylor binary’s orbit is shrinking is roughly 14 times beard
speed, or in our commercial units, Gillette Mach 14 (a razor close shave!).</p>

<p>“Well,” I hear you cry (a bit disappointed…?), “that’s a <em>pretty</em> 
useless unit, but can’t we be <em>more</em> useless?” Yes, dear reader, we 
certainly can! We are currently at
<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xZp-GLMMJ0">Snuggie</a></em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ym65h1bmJ0"></a>
levels of uselessness right now, but I think we can just about bump it up to
<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONJfp95yoE">Member of Congress</a></em>
useless if we try.</p>

<p>A furlong is a unit of length about 200 meters long.
A fortnight is a unit of time about 14 days long. Therefore, if we want
a speed we just…</p>

\[{\rm \frac{furlong}{ fortnight}} =   
 1 \frac{\rm furlong}{\rm fortnight} \times \frac{200 \rm m}{\rm furlong} \times
\frac{1 \rm fortnight}{14 \times 86400 \rm s} = 
 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \frac{\rm m}{\rm s}\]

<p>So the rate of decay of the Hulse-Taylor binary is:</p>

\[3.5 {\rm m/yr} = 
   1.1 \times 10^{-7} {\rm m/s} \times 
        \frac{1 \rm furlong/\rm fortnight}{ 1.6 \times 10^{-4} {\rm m/s}} = 
  7 \times 10^{-4} \frac{\rm furlong}{\rm fortnight}\]

<p>Hooray! So now we know the decay rate of
the Hulse-Taylor binary orbit in two horrible units: either 700
microfurlongs per fortnight or 14 times the speed of beard (AKA Gillette
Mach 14). Please write these in your copybooks now and forever commit
them to memory.</p>

    <em>Buzz Aldrin's bootprint (source: Wikipedia)</em>
</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I stumbled across a bunch of
<a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/images/157">pictures</a>
of Apollo landing sites taken by one of the cameras onboard the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter. The images have a resolution high enough that
you can resolve features on the surface down to about a meter. Looking
at the Apollo 17 <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/lro-apollo-17-landing-site-lithograph/">landing
site</a>,
you can see the trails of both astronauts and a moon buggy. 
It’s pretty cool.</p>

<p>It also got me thinking about how long the landing sites would be
preserved. More specifically, I want to know how long Buzz Aldrin’s
right bootprint (shown, incidentally, to the left) will last on the
Moon. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, the wind and rain that would
weather away a similar bootprint here on Earth are not present and it
seems as though the print would last a really long time. But how long?
Let’s try to quantify it.</p>

<h2 id="pick-your-poison">Pick Your Poison</h2>

<p>Before we get going, we need to figure out what physical process would
be most important in erasing a bootprint from the Moon. Although the
Moon lacks the conventional “weathering” we experience on Earth (due to
wind, rain, etc), it does experience something called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering">space
weathering</a>.” Space
weathering is the changing of the lunar surface due to cosmic rays,
micrometeorite collisions, regular meteorite collisions, and the solar
wind. Of these phenomena, the most apparent
and well-studied would be the meteorites which have covered the Moon in
craters. We adopt the meteorite impact as our primary means of wiping
out a bootprint and restate our question as follows:</p>

<p>“How long would it take for a meteorite to hit the Moon such that 
the resulting crater wipes out Aldrin’s right bootprint?”</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>As it is currently
stated, we can answer our question if we knew the rate of formation and
size distribution of the craters on the Moon. We could count up all the
craters on the Moon (or a particular region of interest) and tabulate
their sizes. This would give us the size distribution. It would also
give us a headache and potentially drive us to lunacy
Luckily, someone has beat us to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966MNRAS.134..245C">Cross (1966)</a> 
used images from the Ranger 7 and 8 missions to count craters and 
determine the size distribution of craters in three regions of the Moon. 
The data for the crater distribution in the Sea of Tranquility 
(where Apollo 11 landed) are given in the figure below. Cross found 
that in the Sea of Tranquility, the number of craters with diameters 
greater than X meters (per million square kilometers) is given by:</p>

\[N(d&gt;X) = 10^{10}\left(\frac{X}{1~\mbox{m}}\right)^{-2},\]

<p>which holds for craters with diameters between 1 meter and 10 
kilometers (see figure below).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/crater_pl.png" width="350" />
  <br />
    <em>Figure 2 from Cross (1966)</em>
</p>

<p>We can also estimate the rate at which craters are formed from this
data. If we assume that the craters formed at a constant rate over the
age of the Moon (about 4 billion years), then we get about 2.5 craters
with diameters above 1 meter formed in a million square kilometer area
every year. This is a “crater flux” for the Moon. Written another way,
the crater flux in the Sea of Tranquility is</p>

\[F \approx 1~{\mbox{km}}^{-2} \frac{1}{4\times10^5~\mbox{yr}},\]

<p>so we get that roughly one crater with diameter greater than 1 meter 
is formed on a square kilometer of the Moon once every 400,000 years 
or so.</p>

<p>We now have enough information to do some simulations.</p>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>

<p>I wrote up a code that simulates craters being formed on a 1 square 
kilometer patch of the Moon. A crater is randomly placed in the 
1 square kilometer region with a diameter pulled from the above 
distribution. The bootprint is placed at the center of the grid 
and craters are formed until we get a “hit.” At that point, the 
time is recorded and the run stops. As a sanity check, I thought 
it would be fun to just let the simulation run without caring if 
the boot was hit or not. By simulating the craters in
this way for 4 billion years, I should get something that looks like the
Moon at the present day. Here’s a 200 m square from my simulation:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/mymoon_wticks.png" width="450" />
  <br />
    <em>Simulated distribution of craters</em>
</p>

<p>and here’s a picture of the same-sized region on the surface of the
Moon:</p>

  <br />
    <em>Actual Image of the Moon (Source: LRO)</em>
</p>

<p>Just eyeballing it, things look pretty good.</p>

<p>Now it’s time for the actual simulation. I ran the simulation 10,000 
times and tabulated the amount of time needed before the bootprint was hit. 
The figure below gives the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a> for
the hit times in the simulation. That is, for each time T, we find the
fraction of simulations in which the bootprint got hit in a time less
than or equal to T. The dashed lines in the plot indicate the amount of
time needed to pass for half of the simulations to have recorded a hit.
This time turns out to be about 24 billion years.</p>

    <em>Cumulative Distribution Function of a Hit</em>
</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-caveats">Conclusions and Caveats</h2>

<p>Based on the simulations, the bootprint on the Moon would have about 
even odds of lasting at least 20 billion years <em>if</em> the primary means 
of destruction is through the formation of a crater from a meteorite. 
However, there are a few caveats that should be addressed. These deal 
with either the details of the simulation or the assumptions we have made. 
In the simulation, we just took at 1 km square patch of the moon and scaled 
back the “crater flux” accordingly. However, this does not fully account 
for all possible craters that can form. For example, our simulation would 
miss an event that hit 50 km away from the target, but had a diameter 
of 100 km. Obviously this would hit the target, but we are only seeding 
craters in the 1 square km region. This would mean that the actual lifetime 
of the bootprint would be less than our 24 billion year figure. Re-running 
with a 10km by 10km square region, we find a lifetime of 18 billion years. 
Thus, an increase in area by a factor of 100 only reduces the age by 25%. 
Considering areas much larger than this makes the simulation prohibitively 
slow, but the order unity effect does not seem too significant.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have made a number of assumptions. The big one is that we 
have assumed that the craters currently seen on the Moon were formed 
uniformly in time. In fact, a large fraction of the craters may have been 
formed when the Moon was still very young (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment">Late Heavy
Bombardment</a>). If
this were the case, we would have greatly overestimated the rate of
crater formation and thus underestimated the time needed to hit the
bootprint.</p>

<p>In spite of these caveats, let’s take our value of 20 billion
years to be accurate. What else can we say? Well, if we are right then
we are wrong because the Moon may not last that long (and it’s hard to
have bootprints on the Moon without a Moon). Current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_cycle">estimates</a> have that the
Sun will expand into a red giant and (potentially) destroy the Earth
(and the Moon) in about 5 billion years. So a record of the Apollo
astronauts’ boot sizes could potentially last as long as the Moon. Not bad.</p>
