    <em>The cause of global warming.</em>
</p>

<p>Good news, everyone! I’m going to tell you about a fairly 
well-posed problem in <em>Futurama</em>.  In the episode “Crimes of 
the Hot,” all of the Earth’s robots vent their various “exhausts” 
into the sky at the same time, using the thrust to push the Earth 
into an orbit slightly further away from the sun. As a result of 
this new orbit, the year is made longer by “exactly one week.” 
Anything that quantitative is pretty much asking to be analyzed.</p>

<p>First, a little background. In this episode, it is learned that 
all the robots (especially Hedonism Bot) emit the greenhouse 
gases responsible for Global Warming. The previous solution (detailed
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2taViFH_6_Y">here</a>) is no longer viable,
so it is decided that all robots must be destroyed (especially Hedonism
Bot). The disembodied head of Richard Nixon rounds up all the world’s
robots on the Galapagos<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to have a “party” so that they may be
destroyed by a giant space-based electromagnetic pulse cannon. In a
last-ditch effort to save the robots, Professor Farnsworth has all the
robots blast their exhausts into the sky, using the thrust to push the
Earth into an orbit further away from the sun, thus solving the problem
of global warming once and for all. As a result of changing the Earth’s
orbit, the year is “exactly one week longer.”</p>

<h1 id="first-pass-through">First Pass Through</h1>

<p>Ok, so what can we say about the new orbit if all we know 
is that its orbital period is exactly one week longer? Well, 
we know from our good buddy Kepler that the square of the 
period of a bound orbit is proportional to the cube of its 
semi-major axis<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, so</p>

\[\tau^2 \propto a^3.\]

<p>We already know the Earth’s period (1 year) and semi-major axis 
(1<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit">AU</a>) before the
robo-boost, so we can get rid of the proportionality by writing things
in terms of the initial values. In other words,</p>

\[\left(\frac{\tau}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^2=\left(\frac{a}{1~\mbox{AU}}\right)^3.\]

<p>Alright, so we know that our new orbital period is 1 year + 1 week, or
since there are 52 weeks in a year, 53/52 years. So our new semi-major
axis is</p>

\[a = \left(\frac{1 + 1/52~\mbox{yr}}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{2/3}\mbox{AU}
    \approx1.013~\mbox{AU},\]

<p>or a little over 1% larger than it is currently. Fair enough. 
So would this fix Global Warming for ever and ever? Let’s see.</p>

<p>The solar flux at some distance \(d\) is given by</p>

\[S = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi d^2},\]

<p>where L is the luminosity of the sun. So the ratio of the flux at the
new semi-major axis<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to that before the orbit was changed is</p>

\[\frac{S}{S_0}=\left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2
             =\left(\frac{a}{1~\mbox{yr}}\right)^{-2}.\]

<p>OK, so we have the flux, but how do we relate this to temperature? 
Well, we know that the power radiated by a blackbody of temperature 
T is given by</p>

\[P = \sigma A T^4,\]

<p>where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law">constant</a>, 
A is the area of the emitting region and T is the temperature. For a
blackbody in equilibrium, the power coming in is going to be equal to
the power going out. The power coming in is just the solar flux times
the cross-section area of Earth, given by</p>

\[P_{in} = S\times\pi R^2_{\oplus}\]

<p>and the power going out is just that radiated by the Earth as a blackbody</p>

\[P_{out} =\sigma \times 4\pi R^2_{\oplus}\times T^4.\]

<p>Equating the power in to the power out gives</p>

\[T = \left( \frac{S}{4\sigma}\right)^{1/4}.\]

<p>Now we can find the ratio of the new average Earth temperature 
to the temperature before the orbital move. We have</p>

\[\frac{T}{T_0} =\left(\frac{S}{S_0}\right)^{1/4}
              =\left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^{1/2}
              \approx0.994\]

<p>If we take the initial average Earth temperature to be something like 
\(T = 300~{\rm K}\), then we find a new temperature of \(T = 298~{\rm K}\). 
A whole 2 degrees cooler!</p>

<p>That may not sound like a lot, but remember, that’s the mean 
global temperature. Apparently, it only takes a few degrees 
increase in global average temperatures to make things uncomfortable 
for people. The IPCC
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">indicates</a> that the
average global surface temperature on Earth in the next century is
likely to rise by about 1 to 2 degrees under optimistic scenarios or
about 3 to 6 degrees under pessimistic scenarios. So the robo-boost
option is at least in the right ballpark here. Neat!</p>

<h1 id="how-big-is-the-push">How Big Is The Push?</h1>

<p>So how big of a push did the robots need to give the Earth to
boost it out to this new orbit? Is this possible? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>First we need to find out how the Earth’s velocity has changed. 
We can do this by finding the change in energy. The total energy 
of a bound orbit is given by</p>

\[E = -\frac{k}{2a}\]

<p>where \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit and 
\(k= GMm\). So the difference in Earth’s energy before and
after the robo-boost is</p>

\[E_f - E_0 =-\frac{k}{2a_f}-\left(-\frac{k}{2a_0}\right)
          =\frac{k}{2a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right).\]

<p>But we also know that Earth’s energy in the orbit is 
given by</p>

\[E = -\frac{k}{r} + \frac{1}{2}mv^2,\]

<p>so the difference in energy before and after is</p>

\[E_f - E_0 =\frac{1}{2}m\left(v^2_f-v^2_0\right),\]

<p>where we have found the energies immediately before and immediately 
after the boost so Earth is pretty much at the same distance from 
the sun, so the potential energy terms cancel. Combining our 
expressions for the change in energy and solving for the final 
velocity, we find</p>

\[v_f = \left[\frac{GM_{\odot}}{a_0}\left(1-\frac{a_0}{a_f}\right)+v^2_0\right]^{1/2}.\]

<p>Taking the initial orbital velocity of the Earth to be 30 km/s, we find
that the final velocity of the Earth immediately after the robo-boost is</p>

\[v_f = 30.2~\mbox{km/s}\]

<p>So the robots just need to give a “little” 200 m/s boost to the Earth, 
right? Well, we are adding velocity vectors here, so it depends on 
which direction the robots are pushing. The magnitude of the final 
velocity is given by</p>

\[v_f = \sqrt{\left({\bf v_0}+{\bf \Delta v}\right)^2}
      =\sqrt{v^2_0+\Delta v^2-2v_0\Delta v\cos{\beta}},\]

<p>where \(\Delta v\) is the boost in velocity caused by the
robots and \(\beta\) is the angle between the initial orbital 
motion of the Earth and the velocity boost from the robots.</p>

<p>If they wanted to make it slightly easier on themselves, 
the robots would have boosted the Earth in the direction it 
was already moving. That would make the \(\cos \beta\) term 
equal to one and thus minimize the necessary boost. However, in the
show the robots appear to point their exhaust right at the sun (see
figure below). This is essentially at a 90 degree angle to the Earth’s
orbital motion, so the \(\cos \beta\) term goes to zero in our 
expression above.</p>

<p>Plugging it all in we find that the magnitude of the robo-boost
is</p>

\[\Delta v \approx 3.5~\mbox{km/s}.\]

<p>We see that this is a fair bit larger than the 0.2 km/s 
needed for a boost parallel to Earth’s initial velocity.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Delta v" src="/images/blog/futurama/delta_v.png" width="400" />
  <br />
    <em>Robots blasting from the Galapagos (which now appear to be in China...)</em>
</p>

<p>Alright, so how much effort would it take to give that kind of boost to
the Earth? We can quantify this effort in terms of a force or in terms
of the energy difference. Let’s do both.</p>

<p>For the force, we have</p>

\[F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}=\frac{M_{\oplus}\Delta v}{\Delta t}.\]

<p>Here we are a little stuck unless we can figure out the duration of the
robo-boost. Watching the episode again, the robots are blasting up
exhaust for about a minute but then the show cuts to commercial. So we
don’t really know how long they were pushing. Let’s just say an hour,
but we’ll leave the time in if we want to fiddle with that.</p>

<p>Plugging in numbers, the total force is</p>

\[F = 6\times10^{24}~\mbox{N}\left(\frac{\Delta t}{1~\mbox{hr}}\right)^{-1}.\]

<p>If this force is spread evenly over the billion robots present<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, then 
each robot would be applying a force of</p>

\[F = 6\times10^{15}~\mbox{N},\]

<p>which is roughly equivalent to the force it would take to lift up 
Mount Everest<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That wasn’t terribly helpful. Let’s look at the work then 
instead. The total work done by the robots to move the Earth 
is</p>

\[W = \frac{1}{2}M_{\oplus}\left(v^2_f - v^2_0\right) 
     \approx 4\times10^{31}~\mbox{J}.\]

<p>Well, that’s a large number. Could a billion robots feasibly do that 
much work? If the robots are each 100 kg, then if the mass of all 
billion robots were directly converted to energy, we would get</p>

\[E = mc^2 = 10^9\times10^2~\mbox{kg}
           \times\left(3\times10^8~\mbox{m/s}\right)^2
         \approx 10^{28}~\mbox{J},\]

<p>or less than a thousandth the total energy needed. So it looks unlikely 
that the robots would be able to push the Earth, but that was to be 
expected.</p>

<h1 id="changes-to-the-orbit">Changes to The Orbit</h1>

<p>Let’s take a look at how the robo-boost affects the entirety of the
Earth’s new orbit. In our first pass through the problem, we ignored the
fact that the shape of the orbit changed and only focused on the new
semi-major axis. To see why we must also consider the changes to the
“shape” of the orbit, take a look at the figure below.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Orbits" src="/images/blog/futurama/orbits.png" width="400" />
  <br />
    <em></em>
</p>

<p>In the figure, the initial orbit is plotted (black dashed line) as well
as two new orbits that each have the appropriate semi-major axis so that
the period of revolution is one year and one week. The difference
between the two final orbits comes from the robots pushing in different
directions. In the blue orbit, the boost was made in a direction
radially outward from the Sun (that is, perpendicular to the orbital
velocity of the Earth). This is the case shown in the <em>Futurama</em> episode.
In the red orbit, the boost was made parallel to the orbital velocity of
the Earth. In each case, the boost was applied at the point labeled with
an “X.”</p>

<p>One thing that jumps out from this figure is that the Earth is
always further away from the sun on the red orbit than it was on the
initial (dashed black) orbit. But on the blue orbit, the Earth is
further away from the Sun than it was initially for only half the orbit.
On the other half, the blue orbit would actually make the Earth’s
temperature <em>higher</em> than it was on the old orbit!</p>

<p>The temperature calculation we made earlier should hold pretty well 
for the red orbit, since it is essentially a circle. It would be a 
little more tricky for the blue orbit, as one would need to get a 
time-averaged value of the flux over the course of the whole orbit. 
A hundred Quatloos to anyone that does the calculation.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap-Up</h1>

<p>So what have we found out here? Well, it seems that there are certain 
scenarios in which boosting the Earth out to a new orbit with period 
of 1 year + 1 week could cool the Earth by a few degrees. Granted, 
we have made some simplifications (the Earth is not a blackbody), 
but the general idea of the thing should still hold.</p>

<p>I had some fun playing around with this problem and I thought it
was neat that there was a good deal of information to get started with
from the episode. The <em>Futurama</em> people gave an exact period and at
least a visual representation of the direction the robots apply their
push. So 600 Quatloos for the writers!</p>

      <p>This is technically incorrect, since the semi-major axis is measured from the center of the ellipse, but the sun is located on one of the foci. However, this requires information on the  eccentricity of the orbit, which we are currently glossing over right now. Our method is then approximate, but becomes exact in the case where both orbits are circles. The effect, however, is minor. At worst, it is semi-minor. <em>Zing!</em> <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>My source for this billion robots number comes from Professor Farnsworth himself. When it looks like the robots will all be destroyed the Professor says “A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished.

      <p>Well, sort of. The height of Everest is \(\sim 10^4~{\rm m}\), so this gives a volume of \(\sim 10^{12}~{\rm m}^3\). The density of most metals is around \(10 {\rm g/cm}^3\), which is \(10^4~{\rm kg/m}^3\). This gives a mass of \(\sim 10^{16}~{\rm kg}\). The weight is then \(\sim 10^{17}~{\rm N}\). Each robot exerts a force of \(\sim 10^{16}~{\rm N}\). So not quite, but hey it was the first thing I thought of and it almost worked out so I’m sticking with it! <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

In <a href="/posts/2024/09/02/streak-part1">Part 1</a>, we solved
the problem in a quick, easy, but approximate way

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>There’s an old Mitch Hedberg joke that goes “rice is great if you’re 
really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something.”  Baseball 
is kind of like that.  You have 162 games in the regular season where 
nine batters will get 3-5 chances to hit each game per team. The chance 
of getting a hit ranges from about 10% (not very good player) to about 
30% (very good player) for each attempt. Over the course of the long 
season, a player can string together a series of hits (hot streak) or 
a series of outs (cold streak).  These streaks could be due to something 
the player is doing (with the intrinsic probability of a hit changing), 
but can often be explained by statistical variance (with a fixed probability).</p>
