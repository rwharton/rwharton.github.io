      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        <p>This is Part 3 of a series exploring a particular probability 
problem encountered while watching my baseball team lose 
(they got <a href="https://www.mlb.com/standings/?date=2024-09-06">better</a>). 
In baseball terms, the question was <em>what is the maximum number 
of losses you expect a good team to have in any 20-game stretch 
during the season</em>. In mathematical terms, the problem can be 
stated as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume we have a binomial process that has two outcomes:
a win or a loss. Let \(p\) be the probability of a win,
so that \(1-p\) is the probability of a loss.  For a list
of \(N\) games, what is the probability that the highest
number of wins (or losses) in any \(M\) game window is
greater than or equal to \(k\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="/posts/2024/09/02/streak-part1">Part 1</a>, we were able 
to answer this question for particular \(N\), \(M\), \(k\), 
and \(p\) by simulating a large number of seasons and 
counting the max values.  It wasn’t an exact solution, 
but was pretty easy. In <a href="/posts/2024/09/05/streak-part2">Part 2</a>, 
we took a very different approach. We considered the very 
small case of \(N=5\) and \(M=3\) and wrote down all 
possible seasons. From this we could calculate the exact 
probabilites for all \(k\) values for any single game 
win probability \(p\). This is exactly what we want… 
except that this method quickly becomes impossibly 
complex.</p>

<p>In this Part 3, we will use what we learned in Part 2, 
but avoid enumerating all \(2^N\) possible season results. 
Instead, we will only keep track of the \(2^M\) possible 
results within a window. For \(N=162\) and \(M=20\), this 
means “only” having to enumerate \(\sim10^6\) states instead 
of the full \(\sim10^{49}\).  Progress!</p>

<h1 id="markov-process">Markov Process</h1>

<p>First, we will need to learn a little something about Markov 
processes. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov process</a> 
is a certain type of random process that generates a series of events. 
In a simple case, let’s say we have two states: A and B. At each step, 
we can either transfer between the states or stay in the current state. 
A key property of Markov chains is that the transition probabilities 
depend <em>only on the current state</em>, so all that matters is if we are 
currently in state A or B.</p>

<p>To generate a list of events with the Markov process, we simply 
look at what state we are currently in, then draw the next state 
based on the transition probabilities. For our simple example, 
lets say that when we are in state A, we can switch to state B 
with probability \(p_{\rm AB} = 0.2\) or stay in state A with 
\(p_{\rm AA} = 0.8\).  When we are in state B, we can transfer to 
state A with probability \(p_{\rm BA} = 0.6\) or stay in state 
B with \(p_{\rm BB} = 0.4\).</p>

<p>If we start in state A, we can follow these rules to produce:</p>

\[\texttt{A A B B A A B A A A B}.\]

<h2 id="transition-matrix">Transition Matrix</h2>

<p>We can also write the probilities in the form of a transition matrix
(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix">stochastic matrix</a>).
Each element of the transition matrix, \(p_{ij}\), will give the probability 
of going from state \(i\) to state \(j\). If we call states A and B states 
0 and 1, we can write:</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix}
p_{00} &amp; p_{01} \\
p_{10} &amp; p_{11} \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
p_{AA} &amp; p_{AB} \\
p_{BA} &amp; p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.8 &amp; 0.2 \\
0.6 &amp; 0.4 \\
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>Though it may take a little getting used to, the transition matrix 
description of a Markov process will make our lives much easier when
we start calculating things.  Let’s start with an easy example.</p>

<p>If we start in State A, what are the probabilites that we are 
in each state after one step? Since it’s just one step, we know 
that the answers are just \(p_{AA}\) for state A and 
\(p_{AB}\) for state B.  But we can also calcualte this 
with the transition matrix:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
p_A &amp; p_B \\
\end{pmatrix}
&amp;=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
p_{AA} &amp; p_{AB} \\
p_{BA} &amp; p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}\\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \cdot p_{AA} + 0 \cdot p_{BA} &amp; 1\cdot p_{AB} + 0 \cdot p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}\\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
p_{AA} &amp; p_{AB} \\
\end{pmatrix} \\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.8 &amp; 0.2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}\]

<p>We can also do the same thing starting from state B:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
p_A &amp; p_B \\
\end{pmatrix}
&amp;=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
p_{AA} &amp; p_{AB} \\
p_{BA} &amp; p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}\\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \cdot p_{AA} + 1 \cdot p_{BA} &amp; 0\cdot p_{AB} + 1\cdot p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}\\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
p_{BA} &amp; p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}\\

&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.6 &amp; 0.4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}\]

<p>where in each case we have specified the starting state 
via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors">row vector</a>. 
I have gone through the operations to make clear how to multiply this 
with a matrix from the right. It’s a little different from what we 
typically see, but is just based on how the transition matrix is 
defined (you could make it a left transition matrix and operate on 
vectors by flipping rows and columns).</p>

<h2 id="many-steps">Many Steps</h2>

<p>One of the nice things about the transition matrix approach is that 
it allows us to calculate probabilities at step \(n\) fairly easily. 
Based on what we saw above for a single step, multiple steps can be 
calculated by repeated multiplications of the transition matrix. 
This is equivalent to a single multiplication of the transition 
matrix to the \(n\)-th power:</p>

\[P^n = 
\begin{pmatrix}
p_{AA} &amp; p_{AB} \\
p_{BA} &amp; p_{BB} \\
\end{pmatrix}^n \\\]

<p>We can now easily calculate this matrix for any \(n\) for the 
problem above.  We have</p>

\[\begin{align}
P^1 &amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.8  &amp;  0.2 \\
0.6  &amp;  0.4 \\
\end{pmatrix} \\

P^2 &amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.76  &amp;  0.24 \\
0.72  &amp;  0.28 \\
\end{pmatrix} \\

P^3 &amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.752  &amp;  0.248 \\
0.744  &amp;  0.256 \\
\end{pmatrix} \\

&amp;\vdots \\

P^{10} &amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.75  &amp;  0.25 \\
0.75  &amp;  0.25 \\
\end{pmatrix} \\

\end{align}\]

<p>where we see something interesting happening. As we get more 
and more steps, the rows of the matrix converge to the same 
values. This means the the probability of being in a given 
state is independent of the starting value.  We can see this 
beter in a plot:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Markov steps" src="/images/blog/bball-3/markov_fig1.png" width="500" />
  <br />
    Fig 1:  <em>Probability of being in state A after n steps assuming 
                we start in state A (blue circle) or state B (orange square)</em>
</p>

<p>This makes sense because the early steps will be affected 
by where we start, but eventually we get far enough away 
that we reach a steady state.</p>

<h2 id="absorbing-state">Absorbing State</h2>

<p>Now what would happen if we added a third state C, that 
would <em>only</em> transition to itself (\(p_{CC} = 1\))? Since 
it does not allow transitions to other states, the chain 
would get stuck in C. For this reason, these states are 
called “absorbing states”.</p>

<p>Let’s modify our example above to include an absorbing 
state. Consider the transition matrix:</p>

\[P = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.7  &amp;  0.2  &amp; 0.1 \\
0.5  &amp;  0.3  &amp; 0.2 \\
0    &amp;   0   &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>which means A goes to \((A, B, C)\) with probability 
\((0.7, 0.2, 0.1)\), B goes to the same with 
probability \((0.5, 0.3, 0.2)\) and C only goes 
to C.</p>

<p>Since all states can go to C, but once there cannot leave, 
then eventually everything will go to state C.  We can see 
this by calculating the result after, say, 10 steps:</p>

\[P^{10} \approx  
\begin{pmatrix}
0.20  &amp; 0.07  &amp;  0.73  \\
0.17  &amp; 0.06  &amp;  0.77  \\
0     &amp;  0    &amp;  1     \\
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>and after 20:</p>

\[P^{20} \approx  
\begin{pmatrix}
0.05  &amp; 0.02  &amp;  0.93  \\
0.04  &amp; 0.01  &amp;  0.94  \\
0     &amp;  0    &amp;  1     \\
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>where each row indicates the probability of being 
in states \((A, B, C)\) for starting state \(A\) (top row), 
\(B\) (middle row), and \(C\) (bottom row).</p>

<p>Absorbing states are useful for indicating a stopping condition, 
since once they reach that state, nothing changes. This is 
exactly what we will use an absorbing state for.</p>

<h1 id="back-to-baseball">Back to Baseball</h1>

<p>Now that we have a bit of background on Markov processes, let’s see 
if we can apply it to the problem at hand.  Once again, our problem 
is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume we have a binomial process that has two outcomes:
a win or a loss. Let \(p\) be the probability of a win,
so that \(1-p\) is the probability of a loss.  For a list
of \(N\) games, what is the probability that the highest
number of wins (or losses) in any \(M\) game window is
greater than or equal to \(k\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we want to keep track of the number of wins (or losses) 
in a running window of \(M\) games. But that depends on the 
current game <strong>and</strong> the \(M-1\) previous games. The <strong>one</strong> 
rule we learned about a Markov process is that it is memoryless 
and can <strong>only</strong> depend on the current state. That is true, 
but we can be tricky about what we call a state.</p>

<h2 id="picking-a-state">Picking A State</h2>

<p>One potential option is to enumerate every single possible 
combination of \(1\)s and \(0\)s in an \(M\) game window. 
From <a href="/posts/2024/09/05/streak-part2">Part 2</a>, we know that 
there are \(2^M\) ways to make a length \(M\) string of 
\(0\)s and \(1\)s. That could potentially get pretty 
unwieldy for large \(M\), but it sure beats enumerating 
every result in the season like we did in Part 2. But 
does it satisfy the Markov condition?</p>

<p>A Markov process has to be memoryless, which means that the 
transition properties can only depend on the current state. 
Let’s say that we have \(M=5\), then one of our states will 
be</p>

\[s_i = 01101.\]

<p>The next possible state is just the string of 5 bits you 
get by shifting the window over one game. So for this 
state, the possible next states are:</p>

\[s_{i+1} = 
\begin{cases}
11010, &amp; \text{if next value is 0} \\
11011, &amp; \text{if next value is 1}
\end{cases}\]

<p>because by moving our window one game over, we have 
lost the trailing \(0\) and picked up either a \(0\) 
or a \(1\).</p>

<p>We can also very easily calculate the transition probabilities 
are because it is simply the probability of getting a one, \(p\), 
or getting a zero \(1-p\). Thus the transition probabilities 
<em>only</em> depend on the current state, which satisfies the Markov 
condition.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>

<p>Since we are enumerating all \(2^M\) possible combinations 
for the contents of our length \(M\) window, we are going to 
have to be very careful about bookkeeping. If \(M=20\), 
we will have \(2^{20} \approx 10^6\) possible states. That’s 
too many to go through and identify by hand. Fortunately, we
can use a clever trick we found in Part 2.</p>

<p>A simple way to enumerate all the \(2^M\) strings of zeros 
and ones is to simply count to \(2^M\) in binary (pre-pending 
zeros as necessary).  So for \(M=5\) we would have</p>

\[\begin{align}
0 &amp;= 00000 \\
1 &amp;= 00001 \\
2 &amp;= 00010 \\
\vdots &amp; \\
29 &amp;= 11101 \\
30 &amp;= 11110 \\
31 &amp;= 11111 
\end{align}\]

<p>This means that we could keep track of each state by recording 
the base-10 number the corresponds to the binary string. This 
makes things much easier. Now, instead of storing, for example,
a 15 game string of wins and losses as</p>

\[s_i = 111101010110111\]

<p>we can instead just store the number</p>

\[s_i = 31415\]

<p>Not bad!</p>

<p>But is there any way to figure what states this 
can transition to? Consider the state:</p>

\[s_i = 11101.\]

<p>It can transition to the following states:</p>

\[s_{i+1} = 
\begin{cases}
11010, &amp; \text{if next value is 0} \\
11011, &amp; \text{if next value is 1}
\end{cases}\]

<p>We described this in terms of shifting the \(M\) game 
window, but if we take the binary represenation seriously,
then shifting one spot to the left is the same as multiplication 
by 2. As our window moves one spot right, all the numbers move 
one spot to the left, meaning one higher power of two. Now, 
there is a little bit of a catch because we are dropping the 
previously leftmost value. But that’s not a problem because 
we can just calculate the number 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo">modulo</a> 
\(2^M\). The modulo is simply the remainder after dividing 
by \(2^M\). Since all of our states are by construction 
less than \(2^M\), this will give us what we want.</p>

<p>Let’s give it a try.  The state \(s_i = 11101\) is the 
binary representation of the (base-10) number 29. So:</p>

\[(29 \times 2) \mathbin{\rm mod} 2^5 = 58 \mathbin{\rm mod} 32 = 26\]

<p>and 26 in binary is \(11010\), which is indeed one of 
the answers that we were looking for.  Since we are mutliplying 
by 2 and taking the modulo with respect to another even number, 
the result here will always be even. But the other valid state 
is exactly the same except the last bit is a 1.  That means 
you just have to add one.</p>

<p>This means that for a given state \(s_i\) in base-10 representation,
we can calculate the valid transitions as:</p>

\[s_{i+1} = 
\begin{cases}
2 s_i \mathbin{\rm mod} 2^M, &amp; \text{newest val a 0} \\
2 s_i \mathbin{\rm mod} 2^M + 1, &amp; \text{newest val a 1}
\end{cases}\]

<p>and the probability of making these transitions is just 
\(p\) if the newest value is a one and \(1-p\) if the 
newest value is a zero.</p>

<h2 id="stopping-condition">Stopping Condition</h2>

<p>Now that we have a neat way to represent our states, we should 
really go back to the problem. What is it we are trying to do 
again? We want to find the probability of getting at least \(k\) 
wins (or losses) in any \(M\) length stretch of games in an 
\(N\) length season. Therefore once we hit a state with \(k\) 
or more wins, we can stop, since our season has already met 
the goal. This sounds like the perfect case for an absorbing 
state!</p>

<p>For any value of \(k\), we will have some states that have 
less than \(k\) wins and others that will have at least 
\(k\) wins. The latter states are really just one state 
then.  That is, they are the state where we have met our 
goal. If we call the states with less than \(k\) wins 
“valid” states then the total number of states we need 
to consider are \(n_{\rm valid} + 1\). This number will 
be less than \(2^M\), but will still be roughly the same 
order of magnitude.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-transition-matrix">Building the Transition Matrix</h2>

<p>To build our transition matrix, we need to calculate \(p_{ij}\) 
between all possible states. But as we have seen above, any given 
state can transition to 2 other states with probability \(p\) if 
it ends in \(1\) or \((1-p)\) if it ends in 0.  That means that 
most of our transition matrix will have rows that are mostly zero, 
but with two nonzero entries.  The final absorbing state, however,
will be all zeros except for a single entry of \(1\).</p>

<p>Previously we showed that any given state could be represented 
as a binary string which could then be turned into a base-10 
number. We could then just index each state by this base-10 number, 
which would be pretty easy.  However, some of these states will 
have have at least \(k\) wins and so would be absorbing states. 
We need to just have one absorbing state, so we will have to map 
all of these to the same index. This means we lose the easy indexing 
of states and are required to do one extra step where we map 
the base-10 number to the index value.</p>

<p>OK, so let’s try building the case where \(N=5\), \(M=3\), and 
we want \(k \geq 2\). For simplicity, let’s set \(p=0.5\). The 
valid states will have no more than 1 win. For \(M=3\), there 
are only 4 valid states:</p>

\[\begin{align}
0 &amp;: 000 \\
1 &amp;: 001 \\
2 &amp;: 010 \\
4 &amp;: 100 \\
\end{align}\]

<p>since any other state would have at least 2 ones. We then add 
one absorbing state to get a total of 5 possible states for this 
process.</p>

\[P = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.5   &amp;  0.5 &amp;   0  &amp;    0  &amp;    0  \\   
 0    &amp;   0  &amp;  0.5 &amp;    0  &amp;   0.5 \\
 0    &amp;   0  &amp;   0  &amp;   0.5 &amp;   0.5 \\
0.5   &amp;  0.5 &amp;   0  &amp;    0  &amp;    0  \\
 0    &amp;   0  &amp;   0  &amp;    0  &amp;    1  \\ 
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>The first row is for \(000\), which can only transition 
to \(000\) (if the next val is a 0) or \(001\) if the next 
value is 1.  The second row is for \(001\) which can only 
go \(010\) or \(011\), which has two wins and thus goes 
to the absorbing state.  The third row is for \(010\), 
which can go to \(100\) or \(101\), which has two wins 
and thus also goes to the absorbing state.  The fourth 
row is for \(100\) which can go to \(000\) or \(001\).
The fifth row is the absorbing state, which can only go 
to itself with probability 1.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-the-probability">Calculating the Probability</h2>

<p>Now that we have our transition matrix, we know how to 
calculate the probability that our system is in a given 
state after \(n\) steps.  That would just be \(P^n\). 
But the way we have defined our states and the way we 
constructed our transition matrix means that we do not 
account for the starting point. We <em>start</em> with a state 
of \(M\) games. That means two things.  First, we only 
need to propagate our system through \(N-M\) steps.
Second, it means that we need to calculate the probability 
of starting in each given state.</p>

<p>Following with our simple example, if we want to calculate 
the probability that we start with state \(000\) and it 
ends up with \(k\geq2\), then we would do</p>

\[P(s_0 = 000, k\geq2) = P(s_0 = 000) \cdot P(k\geq2 | s_0 = 000)\]

<p>In Part 2, we showed that the probability of getting \(n_0\)
zeros and \(n_1\) ones in a string of length \(M\) is</p>

\[P(s_i) = p^{n_1} (1-p)^{n_0}.\]

<p>For the absorbing state, its a little bit different because 
it encompasses all states with at least \(k\) ones. But for 
that we can use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>:</p>

\[P(s_4) = P(\geq k) = \sum_{s=k}^{M} {M\choose s} p^s (1-p)^{M-s}.\]

<p>The probability of getting \(k\geq 2\) at least once 
for each starting state can be read off from the final 
\(N-M\) step transition matrix, \(P^{N-M}\), in the last 
column in the row corresponding to the initial state.</p>

<p>For the transition matrix above with \(N=5\), \(M=2\), and 
\(p=0.5\), we have</p>

\[P^{5-3} = P^2 = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0.25  &amp;  0.25  &amp; 0.25  &amp;  0    &amp; 0.25 \\ 
 0    &amp;   0    &amp;  0    &amp; 0.25  &amp; 0.75 \\ 
0.25  &amp;  0.25  &amp;  0    &amp;  0    &amp; 0.50 \\ 
0.25  &amp;  0.25  &amp; 0.25  &amp; 0     &amp; 0.25 \\ 
 0    &amp;   0    &amp;  0    &amp; 0     &amp; 1 \\ 
\end{pmatrix}\]

<p>So the final answer will be the sum over all states 
of the probability of starting in the state times 
the probability of that state ending in the absorbing 
state. That is:</p>

\[P(k\geq 2) = \sum_{i=0}^{4} P(s_i) P^2_{i4}\]

<p>We would then get:</p>

\[\begin{align}
P(k\geq 2) = &amp; \left[ (0.5^3) (0.25) \right]_{000} \\ 
             &amp;  + \left[ (0.5^2 \cdot 0.5) (0.75) \right]_{001} \\
             &amp; + \left[ (0.5^2 \cdot 0.5) (0.50) \right]_{010}  \\
             &amp;  + \left[ (0.5^2 \cdot 0.5) (0.25) \right]_{100}  \\
             &amp; + \left[ (3 \cdot 0.5^2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.5^3) (1) \right]_{\rm absorb} \\
           = &amp; \frac{23}{32}
\end{align}\]

<p>In Part 2 we found that the probability of getting exactly 2 wins 
was \(15/32\) and the probability of getting exactly 3 wins was 
\(1/4\).  Summing those gives a probability for \(k\geq 2\) of 
\(23/32\), which is exactly what we have here.  That’s good!</p>

<h1 id="what-have-we-done">What Have We Done?</h1>

<p>This part ended up being a bit longer than I expected, so maybe 
it is useful to stop here and take stock of where we are. We 
developed a way to calculate the answer to our question using 
methods for Markov processes. For arbitrary values of \(N\), 
\(M\), \(k\), and \(p\) we can in principle enumerate the 
states, construct a transition matrix, and then finally calculate 
the total probability of getting at least one \(M\) game window 
with \(k\) or more wins.</p>

<p>This is an important achievement over our initial simulations 
because (up to numerical error), we know that the result we 
get will be exactly correct. However, this is still just a 
calculation, we have not found an equation to just plug in 
our parameters and get an answer. Instead we just have a 
method of getting the answer without any of the insight 
of an equation.</p>

<p>There is one big remaining problem, though. Our test case 
was the very small example we were able to previously work 
out by hand. Our calculation here requires a transition 
matrix that will be roughly \(2^M \times 2^M\) in size and 
we need to then calculate the \(N-M\)-th power of that matrix.
At some point we are going to run into some performance issues.
But we’ll deal with that next time!</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>There’s an old Mitch Hedberg joke that goes “rice is great if you’re 
really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something.”  Baseball 
is kind of like that.  You have 162 games in the regular season where 
nine batters will get 3-5 chances to hit each game per team. The chance 
of getting a hit ranges from about 10% (not very good player) to about 
30% (very good player) for each attempt. Over the course of the long 
season, a player can string together a series of hits (hot streak) or 
a series of outs (cold streak).  These streaks could be due to something 
the player is doing (with the intrinsic probability of a hit changing), 
but can often be explained by statistical variance (with a fixed probability).</p>
