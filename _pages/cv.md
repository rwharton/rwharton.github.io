Education
======
* Ph.D in Physics, Cornell University (2017)
* B.S. in Physics and Mathematics, Pennsylvania State University (2009)
    
Skills
======
* Extensive experience handling and processing large 
  astronomical data sets
* Strong programming skills (Python, C) and a proven history
  of developing end-to-end processing pipelines to discover
  faint astrophysical signals
* Developed and still maintain several astronomical processing
  tools on GitHub
* Experience maintaining software in containers like docker and
  Singularity.


Work experience
======
* **Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, (2021-2024)**  
 *NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow (2021-2023)*  
 *JPL Postdoctoral Researcher (2023-2024)*  
  * Member of Planetary Radar and Radio Science group, studying 
    Fast Radio Bursts, pulsars, and radio science
  * Developed many tools and Python-based pipelines to process 
    large data sets of raw telescope data and search for 
    millisecond-duration Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) originating 
    from other galaxies
  * Utilized docker and Singularity containers to maintain 
    software packages and deploy on many computers 
  * Designed and proposed experiments to use radar to monitor 
    space debris in low Earth orbit, use interplanetary spacecraft 
    to probe solar plasma, and use low frequency radio to monitor 
    the Earth ionosphere.
  * Supervisor: Walid Majid

* **Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy, Bonn, Germany, (2017-2021)**  
 *Postdoctoral Researcher*  
  * Member of Fundamental Physics Group, with a focus on searching for 
    pulsars around the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy
  * Developed a Python-based processing pipeline to take a large 
    (~10 TB) interferometric data set from the Very Large Array (VLA),
    form thousands of beams, and then search each of those beams for pulsars.
  * Supervisor: Michael Kramer

* **Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, (2009-2017)**  
 *Graduate Research Assistant*  
  * **Thesis:** *Radio Interferometric Searches for Galactic Center Pulsars
    and Fast Radio Bursts* 
  * Used a wide range of available multiwavelength data to model and 
    constrain the pulsar population in the Galactic center 
  * Helped develop a pulsar backend for the VLA and used it to 
    search for pulsars in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*
  * Developed a beam forming software that made the first arcsecond 
    localization of an FRB.
  * Supervisor: Jim Cordes

    Cornell's annual EYH conference for middle school girls 
* Graduate Student School Outreach Program: *... And Physics For All!* (2011)
  * Designed a series of lesson plans to introduce 
    scientific concepts and ways of thinking for a local 
    class of fifth graders
